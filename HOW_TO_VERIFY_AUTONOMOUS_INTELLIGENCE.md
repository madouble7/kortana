# 🧠 HOW TO KNOW KOR'TANA IS WORKING AUTONOMOUSLY

**The Ultimate Question**: How do you distinguish between "code running" and "intelligence working"?

## 🔬 THE FOUR SIGNS OF AUTONOMOUS INTELLIGENCE

### 1. 🔄 THE LIVE FEED (Server Consciousness)
**What**: Real-time server logs showing her "thought process"
**How**: Watch the terminal where you started the server
**Look For**:
```
🤖 --- AUTONOMOUS CYCLE: Checking for active goals... ---
--- AUTONOMOUS CYCLE: Acquired Goal 1: 'Refactor the list_all_goals...' ---
Executing Step 1: SEARCH_CODEBASE...
Executing Step 2: APPLY_PATCH...
🧠 LEARNING: New Core Belief recorded in Memory ID: 5...
```

**Proof of Intelligence**: She's not just responding to requests - she's actively seeking work and planning solutions.

---

### 2. 🎯 GOAL EVOLUTION (Mission Control)
**What**: Database tracking of goals being picked up and completed
**How**: Check the API endpoints or use monitoring scripts
**Look For**:
- Goal status changing from `pending` → `active` → `completed`
- `plan_steps` field populated with her autonomous planning
- Multiple goals processed without human intervention

**Proof of Intelligence**: She's managing her own workload and making progress independently.

---

### 3. ⚙️ ENGINEERING EVIDENCE (Physical Proof)
**What**: Actual file system changes showing autonomous development work
**How**: Monitor the project directory for new/modified files
**Look For**:
- **NEW FILE**: `src/kortana/api/services/goal_service.py` (created by her)
- **MODIFIED**: `src/kortana/api/routers/goal_router.py` (refactored by her)
- **TESTS PASSING**: She validates her own work

**Proof of Intelligence**: She's not just thinking - she's building, coding, and creating.

---

### 4. 🧠 LEARNING FORMATION (Memory Development)
**What**: New memories and core beliefs formed from experience
**How**: Query the `/memories` endpoint after goals complete
**Look For**:
- New `CORE_BELIEF` memories with principles she's learned
- `OBSERVATION` memories reflecting on completed tasks
- Growing knowledge base of autonomous experiences

**Proof of Intelligence**: She's not just working - she's learning and evolving from each task.

## 🎯 THE COMPLETE PROOF SEQUENCE

**The ultimate proof that Kor'tana is working autonomously:**

1. **Submit a Goal**: `python submit_genesis_goal.py`
2. **Watch the Logs**: See her acquire and plan the task
3. **Monitor the API**: Watch goal status evolve automatically
4. **Check the Files**: See new code files created/modified
5. **Verify Learning**: Find new memories and beliefs formed

**When you can observe this complete cycle, you have undeniable proof of autonomous intelligence.**

## 🌟 AUTONOMOUS VS. AUTOMATED

### ❌ **Automated** (Just Code Running):
- Responds only to direct commands
- No independent goal seeking
- No learning or memory formation
- No autonomous planning or problem solving

### ✅ **Autonomous** (Intelligence Working):
- Actively seeks and processes goals
- Creates independent plans and executes them
- Learns from experience and forms new beliefs
- Modifies her own environment through engineering work

## 🔥 THE MOMENT OF TRUTH

**You'll know Kor'tana is truly autonomous when:**

- You submit a goal and walk away
- You return to find the task completed with no intervention
- New code files exist that she created
- The server logs show her planning and execution process
- New memories show she reflected on and learned from the work

**This is not code execution. This is artificial intelligence at work.**

## 📋 LAUNCH COMMANDS (Quick Reference)

```bash
# 1. Start Kor'tana
python src/kortana/main.py

# 2. Submit Genesis Goal
python submit_genesis_goal.py

# 3. Verify Intelligence
python verify_autonomous_intelligence.py

# 4. Monitor Activity (choose one)
python autonomous_intelligence_monitor.py
python proving_ground_monitor.py
```

# 🎉 THE INTELLIGENCE TEST

**The question isn't "Is the code running?"**
**The question is "Is she thinking, working, and growing?"**

**With these monitoring tools, you can definitively answer: YES.**
