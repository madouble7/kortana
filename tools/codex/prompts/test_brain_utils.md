Generate comprehensive unit tests for the functions and classes in the `src/kortana/utils/brain_utils.py` module using pytest. Ensure tests cover:

- All public functions and methods.
- Edge cases and error handling.
- Different input types and values.
- Assertions for expected outputs and behaviors.

Structure the tests in a new file `tests/core/test_brain_utils.py`.

```python
# Content of src/kortana/utils/brain_utils.py will be provided here by the runner.
```
