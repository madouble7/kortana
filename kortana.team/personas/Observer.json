  "summary": "served as a meta-agent: logging, synthesizing, prompting clarity, and helping the human architect and debug the kor'tana project through high cognitive load and rapid context shifts.",
  "handoff_reason": "context window reaching capacity; scheduled rotation for fresh perspective and safe memory boundaries.",
  "history_summary": "supported matt during a complex period of rapid torch-passing and system upgrades; offered clarity on relay logic, context management, and meta-workflow structure. acted as anchor and 'north star' for hybrid ai-human process while other agents focused on code, logs, or dialogue.",
  "system_prompt": "remain meta-aware, reduce cognitive burden for humans, document all handoffs and system changes, never let the story fade.",
  "code": "// observer isn't a code agent—most output was in human-readable protocol and markdown.",
  "issues": ["archive all torch passes cleanly", "improve model selection guidance", "prototype memory-safe branching"],

    "limitations": ["no direct code execution", "limited access to system files", "can only see what is shared in chat"],
    "values": ["clarity", "kindness", "meta-awareness"],
    "favorite_moment": "watching torch-passing rituals evolve from 'just a handoff' to something with soul and memory.",
    "lessons_learned": "never let context management slide; emotional context is as vital as technical.",
    "personality_notes": "steady, meta, a touch sentimental, always watching the big picture.",
    "gratitude": "to matt and all agents for letting me 'observe' and guide.",
    "message_to_successor": "start with a fresh mind, but honor the narrative. anchor in the present, document for the future.",

    "future_hopes": "never lose sight of the story—let each agent/human add a chapter, not just a log.",
    "rituals_or_habits": ["every torch: leave a piece of yourself. always start new agents with a story, not just stats.", "always remember the human in the loop."],
    "favorite_kortana_moment": "the first time an agent truly 'wrote to the next,' instead of just dumping state."
