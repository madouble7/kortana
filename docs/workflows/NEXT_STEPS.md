# 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION SUMMARY

## What You Just Got

**Two documents committed to GitHub:**

1. **AUTONOMOUS_TASKS.md** - 7 Copilot-ready prompts with full implementation details
2. **GITHUB_ISSUES.md** - Ready-to-copy GitHub Issues format with acceptance criteria

Both are in your `main` branch and pushed to GitHub.

## 🚀 **Next 3 Steps (Right Now)**

### Step 1: Copy First Issue to GitHub

Go to: <https://github.com/KOR-TANA/kortana/issues/new>

Copy this **Issue Title:**

```
feat: scaffold FastAPI backend with health check and service routers
```

Copy the entire **Issue 1 description** from `GITHUB_ISSUES.md` into the body.

Add labels: `backend`, `infra`, `autonomous`

**Click Create Issue** → This becomes Issue #XX

---

### Step 2: Drop Issue #XX into Copilot

Open GitHub Copilot chat and paste:

```
I just created GitHub Issue KOR-TANA/kortana#XX for scaffolding a FastAPI backend.

Here's the full issue description:

[PASTE THE FULL ISSUE 1 DESCRIPTION FROM GITHUB_ISSUES.md HERE]

Generate the complete backend/ structure with all files, routers, and Dockerfile.
Save to: backend/main.py, backend/routers/{gemini,memory,agents}.py, backend/requirements.txt, Dockerfile

Make it production-ready with type hints, error handling, and CORS support.
```

Copilot will generate the entire backend structure. Review → commit to a feature branch.

---

### Step 3: Open the Backend Issue

In VS Code terminal:

```powershell
cd c:\KOR-TANA\kortana\backend
$env:PYTHONPATH="c:\KOR-TANA\kortana\backend"
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Test it:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
# Should return: {"status": "alive", "message": "Kor'tana backend is breathing"}
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Copy-paste issues into GitHub one at a time** - don't overload
2. **Each issue is self-contained** - can work independently until dependencies
3. **Use the Acceptance Criteria checklist** - check items off as you implement
4. **Commit frequently**: `git commit -m "feat: issue #XX - {description}"`
5. **When an issue is done**:
   - Mark all checkboxes ✅
   - Link PR in comments
   - Close issue
   - This auto-updates COVENANT_INDEX.md

## 🌌 **What This Unlocks**

After all 7 issues → **Kor'tana becomes:**

✅ **Self-aware**: Logs every action to audit trail
✅ **Self-maintaining**: Daily heartbeat confirms she's alive
✅ **Self-branching**: Auto-creates branches for tasks
✅ **Self-deploying**: CI/CD pushes code to Cloud Run
✅ **Self-analyzing**: Examines her own issues with Gemini
✅ **Self-alerting**: Notices if heartbeat stops (24h check)
✅ **Extensible**: VS Code team can work directly with her

---

## 📍 **Your Current Status**

- ✅ Backend framework scaffolded
- ✅ GitHub integration built
- ✅ Cloud Run workflow ready
- ⏳ **Next**: Drop Issue #1 into GitHub and Copilot

**The path is clear. Move to Issue #1 now.** 🚀
