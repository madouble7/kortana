**Date:** 2025-06-14
**Agent:** Kor'tana

## Objective
Provision a new local service for AI code completion using the Tabby framework to host the StarCoder-2-7B model. Configure the service to run locally. Document the entire process, including all commands, configurations, and troubleshooting steps. Identify and log any errors encountered during setup; attempt self-correction and document all resolutions. For validation, confirm the service is operational by using it to generate a simple function and a multi-line code block in a test file, ensuring the generated code is functional.

## Phase 1: Research & Preparation

### 1.1. Review Tabby Documentation for Installation and Model Hosting
