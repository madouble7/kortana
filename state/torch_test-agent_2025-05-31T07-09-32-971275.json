The current progress and status are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but the agent is clearly in the process of testing. The next step likely involves executing tests, analyzing results, and potentially debugging or refining the integration based on those results.",

  "history_summary": "Test-agent focused on integrating the torch protocol with the relay system, initially deciding to prioritize a simple model transfer for proof of concept.  Progress was made in establishing a basic connection and sending rudimentary data, however, challenges arose when attempting to serialize and deserialize complex torch tensors, revealing inconsistencies in the data format expected by the relay system. This prompted the agent to shift focus to debugging the serialization process.",
