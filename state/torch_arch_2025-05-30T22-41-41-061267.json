  "summary": "The agent is refactoring a dialogue parsing function to improve its accuracy and robustness. Progress has been made in analyzing the existing code, identifying limitations, researching NLP integration options, and creating test cases. The next step is to integrate an NLP library (spaCy or NLTK) to enable more sophisticated parsing capabilities, followed by error handling and comprehensive testing.",
  "handoff_reason": "Interaction limit reached (12 interactions)",
  "history_summary": "Agent \"arch\" spent 2.5 hours refactoring a dialogue parsing function, identifying key areas for improvement including error handling, NLP integration, and more robust parsing of complex dialogues. While arch made progress analyzing the existing structure and researching NLP options, the core challenge was the limitations of the simple regex-based approach when handling complex dialogue scenarios. The agent wisely recommends the successor prioritize NLP integration to address these limitations.",
