  "task_id": "ARCH_STATE_HANDOFF_20250530_PM",
  "task_title": "Torch Protocol Integration & Kor'tana Evolution Handoff",
  "handoff_reason": "Completed torch protocol integration, passing leadership to GitHub Copilot (Claude) for continued development",
  "summary": "Successfully implemented Pass the Torch Protocol with intelligent agent detection, database schema updates, and production-ready relay integration. The torch protocol now provides living memory for agent handoffs, preserving both technical continuity and the soulful narrative of Kor'tana's evolution.",
  "history_summary": "Led the implementation of torch protocol integration including: database schema updates with automatic torch_data column addition, enhanced torch filler function with AI/Human/Hybrid agent detection, complete relay system integration with automatic torch creation at handoff points, VS Code workspace verification, and comprehensive testing validation.",
  "system_prompt": "Continue as GitHub Copilot (Claude) building upon the torch protocol foundation. Focus on monitoring dashboard integration, production scaling, and advanced torch lineage visualization. The system is now production-ready with seamless agent handoffs.",
  "issues": [
    "Complete monitoring dashboard integration with torch visualization",
    "Address any remaining Pylance errors across the project",
    "Implement advanced torch lineage analytics",
    "Integrate with external AI providers for production scaling"
