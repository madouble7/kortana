  "summary": "The agent is refactoring a function called `parse_dialogue` in `dialogue_parser.py`. While initial analysis and research have been completed, the current implementation has significant limitations in handling complex dialogues. The next critical step is to integrate an NLP library like spaCy or NLTK to improve parsing capabilities and address the identified issues.",

  "history_summary": "Agent \"arch\" decided to focus on NLP integration to improve dialogue parsing beyond simple regex. Despite identifying clear improvement areas and creating edge-case test cases, the complexities of natural language and the limitations of the current implementation presented challenges. While some progress was made in analyzing the existing parser and researching NLP options, a complete refactor was not achieved within the session.",
